# Php-Unique-HTML-Color-Generator-From-String

This is a php code that will generate an html color code from a string given as an input. It is useful in assigning unique html colors to different entities in your code. I have used it to generate unique colors for countries in http://www.musichemicals.com/europe/ and other continent maps.
